# XportReddit
A simple script that processes a sequence of Reddit post URLs containing media. It downloads the media from each post into a temporary folder in order, then opens both the X (formerly Twitter) website and the folder, making it easy to review and repost the content from Reddit to X.

# ArchiveReplayer

A utility script for reconstructing a Git repository’s commit history from archived project files.
It scans an original source directory to map file modification times, then replays those files into a local, offline Git repository as backdated commits, grouped by date and module structure.

ArchiveReplayer is ideal for archival and academic use, such as rebuilding historical coursework or research projects into a versioned Git timeline—without connecting to or pushing to a remote repository.
